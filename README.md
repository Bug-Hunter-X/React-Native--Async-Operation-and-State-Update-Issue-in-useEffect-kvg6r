# React Native Asynchronous Operation Bug
This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications involving asynchronous operations within the `useEffect` hook and the potential for state updates after component unmounting.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, which fetches data from an API and updates component state.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to avoid warnings and unexpected behavior related to this issue.  The issue arises from the asynchronous nature of data fetching â€“ state updates can occur even after the component has unmounted, leading to potential problems. The solution utilizes cleanup functions to avoid such situations.
